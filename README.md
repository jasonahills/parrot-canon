# Parrot Can(n)on

A tool for recording sound and quickly playing it back.  I use it for practicing mandolin; I can immediately hear what I just played.  It's basically a loop pedal with better options for seeking "that one part that you just aren't getting right".

You can record, play, and pause with a MIDI controller (right now it will loop `record` -> `play` -> `pause` -> `record`, etc. on every MIDI event it receives).

Additionally you can use keyboard shortcuts as well.
